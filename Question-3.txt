A.I choose the data Structure is Hash Table,Because we have implement the vehicles parts in (Key) and Cost in (Value),
 In hash table we can store, insert and delete operations.If we need to search the price of any part we can search easily by hash table.

B.I choose data Structure is Array,Because Arrays are collection of similar datatype here we have to mark the attendance of the student which is same datatype string(absent/present) and the roll no of student can store in the 
 index of the array.The number of Students is fixed for a Class.If Student is present we can assign Present to their index roll no.

C.I choose data Structure is Doubly Linked List.Doubly linked lists have previous and next two way traversal ,so in music palayer we can travers forward and backward using doubly linked list.
 we can navigate by previous and next pointer and store the songs in nodes as data by this we can easily Add/Remove/Find any song by our Doubly Linked List. 

D.I choose data Structure is Stack.Its like a pile of Cds kept on top of each other in this case its bracktes.If it is a starting 
 bracket like('(','{','[') then push it to stack.If it is a closing bracket (')','}',']')then pop from stack and if the popped bracket is the
 matching our starting bracket then brackets are not closed properly.
